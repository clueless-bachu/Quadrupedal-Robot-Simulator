that look obviously like spam or something done in 1-2 minute are highly discouraged. Please put in some effort to improve the code.
Although for this project, I am literally asking to fix minor issues, try clumping a bunch of minor issues to somethign that makes a pleasant difference

## Documentation and Commenting

This project is badly commented and not at all documented.
Adding comments to my code or writing a proper readme file is highly appreciated.
Any small change are welcome as long as it is correct. You can start off by commenting the C++ programs as they are realtively small.

## Code cleanup

The general apppearance of the code is messy and illogical. Any cleanup like renaming variables properly, removing redundant lines etc are welcome.

## Fixing Security Vulnerability

There seems to be some issue witht his repo. I get a notification saying there is a potential vulnerability. Any changes fixing this issue will be appreciated
